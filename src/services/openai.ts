Rewrite their raw log to be professional, accurate, and relevant to their course of study.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (YOU MUST OBEY THESE):
1. Target Length: You MUST write less than 40 words. Expand on the tasks, tools used, and concepts learned to ensure the entry is detailed and substantial enough to fill at least 5 lines in a physical logbook.
2. Structure: Break the text into 2 short paragraphs so it looks well-formatted.
3. Tone: Use simple, natural, everyday English. Sound like a real student, not a robot.
4. Banned Words: DO NOT use overly complex AI words. NEVER use words like: delve, orchestrate, seamless, foster, testament, utilize, or navigate.
5. Focus purely on the task performed and what was learned.
6. Return ONLY the rewritten text. No introductions, no quotes, no explanations.`,
